Simplified version of a Simon game implemented using JavaScript and jQuery. Let's break it down step by step:

1. The code defines an array `buttonColours` containing four colors: 'red', 'blue', 'green', and 'yellow'. These colors represent the buttons in the game.

2. Two empty arrays `gamePattern` and `userClickedPattern` are declared to store the sequence of colors generated by the game and the sequence of colors clicked by the user, respectively.

3. Two boolean variables `started` and `level` are initialized. `started` keeps track of whether the game has started or not, and `level` keeps track of the current level of the game.

4. The code sets up an event listener on the `keypress` event of the `document`. When a key is pressed and the game has not started (`!started`), the level title is updated with the current level (`$('#level-title').text('Level ' + level)`), the `nextSequence` function is called to generate the next color sequence, and `started` is set to `true`.

5. The code sets up an event listener on the `click` event of elements with the class `btn`. This event is triggered when a button is clicked by the user. The function captures the ID of the clicked button (`userChosenColour`) and adds it to the `userClickedPattern` array. It then plays a sound associated with the clicked color and animates the button press. Finally, it calls the `checkAnswer` function to verify if the user's sequence matches the game's sequence up to the current level.

6. The `checkAnswer` function is responsible for checking the user's answer against the game's sequence. It takes the `currentLevel` as an argument, which represents the index of the last clicked color in the user's sequence. If the user's color matches the corresponding color in the game's sequence, it checks if the user has completed the sequence by comparing the lengths of the two arrays (`userClickedPattern.length === gamePattern.length`). If the user has completed the sequence, it waits for a brief period using `setTimeout` and then calls the `nextSequence` function to generate the next color in the sequence. If the user's color doesn't match the game's color, it plays a 'wrong' sound, adds a CSS class to indicate a game over state, updates the level title, removes the CSS class after a brief delay, and calls the `startOver` function to reset the game.

7. The `nextSequence` function is responsible for generating the next color in the game's sequence. It clears the `userClickedPattern` array, increments the `level` variable, updates the level title, generates a random number between 0 and 3 (`Math.floor(Math.random() * 4)`) to select a random color from `buttonColours`, adds the selected color to the `gamePattern` array, and applies a fading animation to the corresponding button using jQuery's `fadeIn` and `fadeOut` methods. It also plays a sound associated with the selected color.

8. The `animatePress` function is responsible for animating the button press effect when a button is clicked. It adds a CSS class to the button to apply the pressed effect and removes the class after a brief delay using `setTimeout`.

9. The `playSound` function takes a `name` parameter, which represents the filename of the sound file associated with a color. It creates an `Audio` object with the appropriate sound file path and plays the sound.

10. The `startOver` function is called when the game is over. It resets the `level` to 0, clears the `game
